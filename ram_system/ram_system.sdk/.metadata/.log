When AXI DMA Channel is not halted (DMASR.Halted = 0), a write by the CPU to the TAILDESC_PTR register causes the AXI DMA SG Engine to start fetching descriptors or restart if it was idle (DMASR.Idle = 1). If it was not idle, writing TAILDESC_PTR has no effect except to reposition the pause point.
If the AXI DMA Channel is halted (DMASR.Halted = 1 and DMACR.RS = 0), a write by the CPU to the TAILDESC_PTR register has no effect except to reposition the pause point.
Note: The software must not move the tail pointer to a location that has not been updated. The software processes and reallocates all completed descriptors (Cmplted = 1), clears the completed bits and then moves the tail pointer. The software must move the pointer to the last descriptor it updated. Descriptors must be 16-word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80, and so forth. Any other alignment has undefined results.
